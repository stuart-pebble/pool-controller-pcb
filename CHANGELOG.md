## [TODO]
- Complete revision 15 prototype acceptance (see docs/rev15-assembly.md).


## [Unreleased] — Revision 15 prototype — 2026-09-12
### Added
- D3 BAT54,215 RX clamp to the Waveshare module 3.3 V rail through J4 pin 3 (issue #3).
- Project-local clamp symbol and retained custom RJ12 footprint.
- Sample fabrication/assembly outputs and a functional acceptance checklist.
- Pin-adjacent VIN/RX/TX/GND labels for J3.
- PCBWay carrier BOM excluding already-purchased Waveshare modules, SMT-only centroid, and nominated supplier links for all carrier parts.

### Changed
- R3 TX base resistor from 1 kΩ to 560 Ω (issue #4; called R4 in older revisions). R4 stays 100 kΩ.
- J1/J2 to Ckmtw R-RJ11R06P-A000 (LCSC C2902699), with new drilled footprint and connector-region routing. Larger tab-down body requires enclosure/retention review.
- L1 BOM primary to the previously listed Bourns SRR1050A-121Y; no automatic substitute.

### Validation status
- Prototype revision; physical validation remains required. The rail clamp does not provide power-off isolation.
- PCBWay quote acceptance, legacy-part stock, connector fit on the 1.2 mm board and module installation remain required before assembly.
